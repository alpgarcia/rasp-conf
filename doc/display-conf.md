Configure a 3.5inch display (XPT2046 touch controller)
======================================================

To get my display working I followed [a post from retropie.org.uk forum][1]. [Once I had Retropie installed installed in my SD card][2], I followed these steps:

1. Plug my TFT and boot up RPi.
2. Once Retropie is up and running, [connect to my Rpi using ssh][3]:
  ```
  ssh pi@192.168.1.xxx

  (If you haven't changed it, pass should be 'raspberry')
  ```
