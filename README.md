# rasp-conf
Configuration stuff for Raspberry Pi B+ with a TFT 3.5". This repo contains all the stuff I've used to configure my Raspberry with Retropie, a Wi-Fi dongle and a 3.5" TFT touch screen.

Most of what I'll write here will be information collected from different sources. I'll try to provide links to the original sources together with the steps I followed to get things working.

##Â Contents
Below there is a quick summary of what you can find in each folder:
* doc: markdown files about how to configure things.
* conf: configuration files to customize different tools I like to use.
